# 3DEngine

Minimalistic 3D Engine written using a C++ Graphics Library (SFML).

### Features
- [x] load .obj files (in triangulated mesh mode only)
- [x] apply translations and rotations on objects
- [x] handle pseudo-lightning system
- [x] move around
- [ ] clipping
- [ ] apply textures

Hold `D` to display the triangles mesh. \
Use `A` and `Z` to move on X axis. \
Use `Q` and `S` to move on Y axis. \
Use `W` and `X` to move on Z axis. \

----

⚠️ For the moment, you can only load one object at a time.

⚠️ As the engine is not so powerful and optimised, you may not load objects that have more than 50k triangles and 20k vertices.
